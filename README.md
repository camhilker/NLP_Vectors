Refining the Word2Vec process used in BacSeq Clustering Repo

Here I use the Gensim Word2Vec embeddings training process to train a model using (as a corpus) all of the vector sequences
available on NCBI. Future direction is to apply this model to a soil microbiome sample in order to detect the presence of 
vectors within the sample.
